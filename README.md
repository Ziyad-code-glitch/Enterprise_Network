# Enterprise Network Configuration

Welcome to the **Enterprise Network Configuration** project! This repository contains configuration details for setting up an enterprise network, including VLANs, routing, IP phone integration, and wireless settings. Below is an overview of the configuration setup.

## üåç Project Overview

This project involves configuring network devices to establish a comprehensive enterprise network. The setup includes:

- **VLAN Configuration**: Definition of VLANs for different types of network traffic.
- **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**: Configuration of primary and secondary STP roots for VLANs.
- **Trunk Ports**: Setup of trunk ports on switches to handle multiple VLANs.
- **IP Addressing**: IP addressing for VLAN interfaces and routing.
- **Dynamic Routing**: OSPF configuration for dynamic routing between switches.
- **NAT Configuration**: Setup of NAT on routers for internet access.
- **IP Phone Integration**: Configuration for Cisco IP phones and DHCP for various VLANs.
- **Wireless Settings**: Configuration of wireless access points and integration with the network.

## üìÅ File Structure

- **`/config`**: Contains configuration files for routers, switches, and wireless access points.
- **`/docs`**: Contains documentation and network diagrams.
- **`/scripts`**: Contains automation scripts for configuration.

## üìñ Configuration Details

### VLAN Configuration

Defined VLANs for different network segments (e.g., Guest, Employee, VOIP, DATA).

### Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

Configured primary and secondary STP root switches for various VLANs.

### Trunk Ports

Configured trunk ports to allow multiple VLANs across switches.

### IP Addressing

Assigned IP addresses to VLAN interfaces and configured routing.

### Dynamic Routing

Configured OSPF routing protocol for network routes and redistribution.

### NAT Configuration

Configured NAT for internal network access to external networks.

### IP Phone Integration

Set up Cisco IP phones and DHCP settings for IP phone support.

### Wireless Settings

Configured wireless access points to provide Wi-Fi connectivity.
Integrated wireless settings with the network VLANs for seamless wireless access.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Review Configuration Files**

   Check the `/config` directory for configuration files relevant to your network devices and wireless access points.

3. **Apply Configurations**

   Use the provided configuration files to set up your network devices and wireless access points.

4. **Verify the Setup**

   Ensure all configurations are correctly applied by checking VLANs, trunking, STP, routing, NAT, IP phone functionality, and wireless connectivity.
